# Design Patterns in the Hyperledger Fabric DApp

This document outlines the key design patterns used across the backend, frontend, and network components of the application.

## Backend (Node.js/Express)

### 1. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern

- **Models**: Prisma ORM models for database interactions, providing a clean abstraction layer for data operations
- **Views**: JSON responses for API endpoints, ensuring consistent response formats
- **Controllers**: Route handlers in `/controllers` directory, managing business logic and request/response flow
- **Routes**: API route definitions in `/routes` directory, handling endpoint mapping and middleware integration

### 2. Middleware Pattern

- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT-based authentication for secure API access
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Centralized error handling with consistent error responses
- **Request Context Middleware**: Context management for requests, maintaining state across middleware chain
- **CORS Middleware**: Cross-origin resource sharing configuration for secure cross-domain requests

### 3. Repository Pattern

- **Database Operations**: Abstracted through Prisma ORM, providing a clean interface for data access
- **Blockchain Operations**: Abstracted through gateway and contract interfaces, separating blockchain logic from business logic
- **Data Access Layer**: Centralized data access methods, ensuring consistent data handling across the application

## Frontend (Next.js/React)

### 1. Component-Based Architecture

- **Atomic Design**: Components organized by complexity (atoms, molecules, organisms), promoting reusability and maintainability
- **Composition**: Reusable components composed together to build complex UIs
- **Layout Components**: Shared layout structure ensuring consistent UI across the application
- **Component Hierarchy**: Clear parent-child relationships for efficient state management

### 2. Context Pattern

- **Auth Context**: Global authentication state management, providing user session information
- **Theme Context**: Theme management and persistence, enabling dynamic UI theming
- **Verification Context**: User verification state management, handling user verification flow
- **State Distribution**: Efficient state sharing across component tree without prop drilling

### 3. Custom Hooks Pattern

- **useAuth**: Authentication state management and methods
- **useTheme**: Theme management and switching functionality
- **useVerification**: Verification state management and methods
- **Logic Reusability**: Encapsulated business logic for reuse across components

## Network (Hyperledger Fabric)

### 1. Chaincode Pattern

- **Smart Contract**: Business logic implementation in Go, defining the core blockchain operations
- **State Management**: World state management through CouchDB, ensuring data consistency
- **Transaction Management**: ACID properties enforcement for reliable blockchain operations
- **Business Logic**: Encapsulated business rules and validation within chaincode

### 2. Gateway Pattern

- **Network Connection**: Abstracted network connection management, simplifying blockchain interaction
- **Channel Management**: Channel-based privacy and isolation for secure data handling
- **Identity Management**: Certificate-based authentication for secure access
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient management of blockchain network connections

### 3. Observer Pattern

- **Event Handling**: Event-driven architecture for blockchain events, enabling real-time updates
- **State Changes**: Monitoring and reacting to state changes in the blockchain
- **Event Propagation**: Efficient distribution of blockchain events to relevant components
- **State Synchronization**: Keeping application state in sync with blockchain state
