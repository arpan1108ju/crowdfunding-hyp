# University Crowdfunding Platform - Project Overview

## 1. Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Universities and educational institutions often struggle with managing crowdfunding campaigns for various projects while maintaining transparency and trust. Traditional crowdfunding platforms have several limitations:

- Lack of transparency in fund utilization
- High transaction fees
- Limited control over campaign management
- No built-in verification system for donors
- Difficulty in tracking and managing multiple campaigns

### Why Blockchain?

Blockchain technology offers several advantages for this use case:

- Immutable transaction history
- Transparent fund flow
- Smart contract-based automated execution
- Decentralized trust
- Programmable token economics

## 2. Available Approaches

### Public Blockchain (Ethereum)

Initially, the project was implemented on Ethereum with the following characteristics:

- Public network with native cryptocurrency (ETH)
- Smart contracts for campaign management
- Token-based reward system
- Transparent transaction history

**Limitations:**

- Fluctuating cryptocurrency value
- High gas fees
- Limited control over token economics
- Public exposure of all transactions
- Regulatory concerns for educational institutions

### Traditional Systems

Traditional crowdfunding platforms offer:

- Centralized control
- Fiat currency support
- User-friendly interfaces
- Established payment gateways

**Limitations:**

- Lack of transparency
- High platform fees
- Limited automation
- Centralized trust model
- No built-in verification system
